### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of
classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-T09-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java)
and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-T09-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is
in charge of the app launch and shut down.

* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues
the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding
  API `interface` mentioned in the previous point).

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using
the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component
through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the
implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified
in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-T09-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts
e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `ClientListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`,
inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the
visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that
are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of
the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-T09-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java)
is specified
in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-T09-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Client` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API
** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-T09-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API
call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is invoked to execute a command, it delegates the command to an `BookKeeperParser` object. This object
   then
   creates a parser corresponding to the command type (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and utilizes it to interpret the
   command.
2. This process generates a `Command` object (to be more specific, an instance of one of its subclasses, e.g.,
   DeleteCommand) which is then executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. During execution, the command can interact with the `Model` (e.g., to delete a `Client` or manage `Order`
   details).<br>
   While this interaction is depicted as a singular step in the above diagram for the sake of simplicity, the actual
   implementation may involve multiple interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to accomplish the
   intended task.
4. The outcome of the command's execution is encapsulated within a `CommandResult` object, which is then returned from
   `Logic`. Additional classes in `Logic` (not shown in the class diagram above) that are utilized for parsing a user
   command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

### Model component

**API
** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-T09-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="682" />


The `Model` component,

* stores bookkeeper data i.e., all `Client` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueClientList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Client` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which
  is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Client>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to
  this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores the currently 'selected' `Order` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which
  is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Order>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to
  this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as
  a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they
  should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `BookKeeper`, which `Client` references. This allows `BookKeeper` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Client` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>

### Storage component

**API
** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-T09-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

Below is an updated UML class diagram illustrating the relationships and interactions among the various storage-related
classes:

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component of our application is responsible for handling the reading and writing of data to and from
external storage sources.
This includes functionalities such as saving and retrieving bookkeeper data and user preferences.
In this section, we will delve into the recent enhancements made to the `Storage` component, focusing on the
implementation of storing clients and order details.

In this enhancement, the `Storage` component has been extended to support the storage and retrieval of both client and
order details.
Previously, the `Storage` component was primarily designed to handle bookkeeper data and user preferences. However,
with the growing requirements of our application, it becomes necessary to accommodate the storage of clients and orders.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Adding the Order methods

![BetterOrderClassDiagram.png](images%2FBetterOrderClassDiagram.png)

#### Command and CommandParser Implementations

To implement the new Order Logic, a new package has to be created within the commands and parser packages to cater to
the order implementations. The key changes would be:

- Creation of new classes:
    - Created a `AddOrderCommand` class to cater to order creation inputs by the user. This will get the
      referenced `Client` by their index in the `ObservableList` and check if the `Client` index is valid.
      Afterwards, it will create & append the `Order` object into the `Client` object's respective orders list.
      Upon execution of this command, it will return the `CommandResult` on for the output box to indicate if it was a
      successful command or not.
    - Created a `DeleteOrderCommand` class to cater to delete orders by their index in their `ObservableList` class.
      This will allow the users to delete by index instead of the UUID. The `DeleteOrderCommand` first checks
      the `ObservableList` by index to determine if the `Order` index is valid, then checks which `Client` the `Order`
      object belongs to. This allows the modification of both `Client`s and `Order`s at the same time.
      Upon execution of this command, it will return the `CommandResult` on for the output box to indicate if it was a
      successful command or not.

    - Created a `EditOrderCommand` class to cater to allow editing Orders by the user. It will first search the `Order`
      objects in the `ObservableList` to ensure that the index is valid, before finding the `Client` object that
      the `Order` object belongs to.
      Afterwards, the `Order` object is edited, and will be replaced in the `Client` object's orders list to update the
      details. This will be encapsulated and returned in a `Command` object that will be executed in the main logic.
- Creation of new parser classes:
    - Creating a `AddOrderCommandParser` class to create the respective `Command` object by parsing the user input. This
      flow is as intended, and will allow us to get index of the `Client` object in the `ObservableList` and get the
      required parameters typed by the user by parsing it with
      the `Prefix` objects in `CliSyntax` class.
      For this command, the prefixes used would be `d/` for description, `c/` for price and `by/` for the deadline.
      The respective `AddOrderCommand` will be created to be executed by the `LogicManager`.
    - Creating a `DeleteOrderCommandParser` class to create the respective `Command` object by parsing the user input.
      This flow is as intended, and will allow us to get index of the Order object in the `ObservableList`.
      This will create the respective `DeleteOrderCommand` to be executed by the `LogicManager`.
    - Creating a `EditOrderCommandParser` class to create the respective `Command` object by parsing the user input.
      This flow is as intended, and will allow us to get index of the Order object in the `ObservableList` and get the
      required parameters typed by the user by parsing it with
      the `Prefix` objects in `CliSyntax` class. For this command, the prefixes used would be `d/` for description, `c/`
      for price and `by/` for the deadline.
      These prefixes are optional, and not including them will use the current `Order` object details.
      At the end this will create the respective `EditOrderCommand` to be executed by the `LogicManager`.

- Update `Model` and `ModelManager` to provide methods to support the new classes. such as creating the
  new `ObservableList` object for `Order` objects to
  update the JavaFX element in the UI.

#### Why is it implemented this way:

It was done in this manner to adhere to the following design principles:

- Separation of Concerns: By delegating specific responsibilities to specialized classes (like `BookKeeperParser`,
  `AddOrderCommandParser`, etc.), the design adheres to the principle of separation of concerns. This means each part of
  the system has a clear responsibility, reducing complexity and making the codebase easier to understand and maintain.
- Provide Extensibility: With a modular structure, adding new functionality (like future order implementations)
  involves creating new classes and modifying existing ones minimally. This approach makes the system more extensible,
  as seen with the introduction of new parser and command classes for handling orders.
- Enhances Frontend Integration:  By redefining how the `ObservableList` is managed within the `ModelManager` for
  Orders, we enhance our capability to directly manipulate the `OrderList` view in JavaFX. This adjustment in the
  ModelManager class creates a seamless and responsive interaction between the backend data structures and the frontend
  user interface.

By doing so, am able to emphasize on the clear separation of duties among components and allowing flexibility to add
new features with minimal disruption This strategy not only facilitates easier maintenance and scalability but also
enhances our future ability to develop and create requirements or changes in functionality without affecting much of the
codebase.

How the parsing works:

* When called upon to parse a user command, the `BookKeeperParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a
  placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse
  the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `BookKeeperParser` returns back as
  a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser`
  interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

#### Storage Implementations

To implement this feature, several modifications were made across different classes within the `Storage` package. The
key changes include:

1. New Classes: The introduction of `JsonAdaptedClient` and `JsonAdaptedOrder` classes to facilitate the conversion
   between JSON format and the corresponding model objects (`Client` and `Order`).

2. Updated Interfaces: The `BookKeeperStorage` interface was extended to included methods for reading and writing
   orders. Similarly, the `Storage` interface, which serves as an umbrella for all storage-related functionalities,
   was update to incorporate these changes.

3. Storage Manager: The `StorageManager` class, which orchestrates the storage operations, was modified to delegate the
   handling of client and order data to the appropriate storage classes.

4. Unit Tests: Unit tests were added or updated to ensure the correctness and robustness of the new functionalities.

#### Why it is implemented that way:

With the implementation of storing clients and orders details, the `Storage` component of our application has been
enhanced to better meet the evolving needs of our users. These changes not only improve the functionality of our
application but also lay the groundwork for future enhancements and features.

Future plans may involve further optimizing the storage mechanisms, exploring alternative storage formats, or
integrating additional data validation checks to ensure data integrity. Overall, the recent enhancements to
the `Storage` component
mark a significant step forward in enhancing the robustness and flexibility of our application.

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedBookKeeper`. It extends `BookKeeper` with an undo/redo
history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the
following operations:

* `VersionedBookKeeper#commit()`â€” Saves the current bookkeeper state in its history.
* `VersionedBookKeeper#undo()`â€” Restores the previous bookkeeper state from its history.
* `VersionedBookKeeper#redo()`â€” Restores a previously undone bookkeeper state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitBookKeeper()`, `Model#undoBookKeeper()`
and `Model#redoBookKeeper()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedBookKeeper` will be initialized with the
initial bookkeeper state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single bookkeeper state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th client in bookkeeper. The `delete` command
calls `Model#commitBookKeeper()`, causing the modified state of bookkeeper after the `delete 5` command executes
to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted bookkeeper
state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new client. The `add` command also
calls `Model#commitBookKeeper()`, causing another modified bookkeeper state to be saved into
the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitBookKeeper()`, so bookkeeper state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the client was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing
the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoBookKeeper()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer`
once to the left, pointing it to the previous bookkeeper state, and restores bookkeeper to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial BookKeeper state, then there are no previous BookKeeper states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoBookKeeper()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.png)

The `redo` command does the opposite â€” it calls `Model#redoBookKeeper()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once
to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores bookkeeper to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest bookkeeper state, then there are no undone BookKeeper states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoBookKeeper()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify bookkeeper, such
as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitBookKeeper()`, `Model#undoBookKeeper()` or `Model#redoBookKeeper()`.
Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitBookKeeper()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not
pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all bookkeeper states after the `currentStatePointer` will be
purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern
desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire bookkeeper.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
    * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the client being deleted).
    * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

_{more aspects and alternatives to be added}_

### View Orders feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed View Orders mechanism is facilitated by `ViewOrdersCommand`. It extends `Command` and implements the
displaying of all orders that belong to a client.

These operations are exposed in the `BookKeeperParser` class as `BookKeeperParser#parseCommand()`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the view orders mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedBookKeeper` will be initialized with the
initial bookkeeper state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single bookkeeper state.

Step 2. The user executes `viewOrders` command to view all the orders that they have in BookKeeper. The `viewOrders`
command calls `Model#updateFilteredOrderList()`, causing bookkeeper to show the list of orders
that are tracked in the storage of the application. The `viewOrders` command then returns a new `CommandResult`, which
displays the `MESSAGE_SUCCESS` message, which is "Here are all your orders: ".

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How view command executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Retrieves and displays all client orders from the filtered order list.
    * Pros: Simple and straightforward implementation.
    * Cons: May result in a slower performance and higher memory usage if the filtered order list is large.

* **Alternative 2:** Implement system for displaying orders and only load a subset of orders at a time.
    * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. can use cache mechanisms to store recently accessed orders in memory).
    * Cons: More complex implementation of storage and memory access.

**Why is it implemented that way**

* This approach is chosen for its simplicity. By utilising the filtered order list maintained by the model, the
  `viewOrders` command provides a straightforward way to display all orders to the user. It also makes it easier to
  maintain.

## **Appendix: Planned Future Enhancements (Beyond v1.4)**

Team size: 4

1. Enhanced Error Messaging

**Current**: Our edit command function's error messages for both client and order are too general, not specifying
the exact issue with the input command causing the error. They address potential errors rather than pinpointing the
specific one the user is facing. This ambiguity extends to other functions like add and delete command as well.

**Future**: We plan to implement more specific error messages tailored to the respective errors encountered. This will
offer clearer guidance to users, helping them identify and resolve issues promptly.

2. Enhanced Error Messaging for Wrong Indices with Missing Fields

**Current**: Similarly, currently our error messages for wrong indices and missing fields in the edit command lack
specificity. We provide a generic message like "at least one field to edit must be provided," without indicating which
field is missing or if there's an issue with the index.

**Future**: We plan to refine these error messages to explicitly highlight the missing field or incorrect index,
enabling users to identify the problem immediately and take appropriate action.

3. Extended Tag Length and Error Refinement

**Current**: Our application now imposes limitations on tag length, restricting users from inputting longer tags,
which may hinder organization and labeling efforts.

**Future**: To address this, we aim to extend the maximum length of tags supported within the system. This enhancement
will empower users to provide more descriptive labels and organize content more effectively, enhancing usability.

4. Resolution Support

**Current**: Our application currently only support a single type of screen resolution, limiting compatibility
with various devices and user preferences.

**Future**: Recognizing the importance of catering to diverse user needs, we plan to expand our resolution support
to include additional screen resolutions such as 1280x720. This will ensure compatibility across a broader range of
devices, enhancing accessibility and user experience.

5. Allow filtering of orders based on displayed customers.

**Current**: Our application now lacks the functionality to filter orders based on displayed clients,
which may lead to inefficiencies for users managing multiple clients.

**Future**: We plan to enable users to filter orders based on the displayed client, streamlining the experience
and improving efficiency for users managing multiple clients simultaneously.

6. Allow adding of multiple users with the same name.

**Current**: Currently, our application rejects the addition of multiple clients with the same name
unless they differ in case sensitivity (e.g., Jane Low and Jane low are acceptable).

**Future**: We intend to enhance our system to allow the addition of multiple clients with identical names,
recognizing that it is common for clients to share the same name. This improvement will enable users to manage
multiple clients with similar names more effectively.

7. Relax constraints on field data types

**Current**: Our application lacks constraints on the data types of input fields, allowing excessively long names
and unrealistically large values for certain fields like order price.

**Future**: We plan to implement constraints on field data types to prevent issues such as overly long fields
not displaying correctly and unrealistic values being entered. For example, we'll limit the length of names and
constrain the size of numerical values like order prices to ensure data integrity and usability.

* E.g. do not input a name that is too long, as it may not be displayed correctly.
* E.g. do not input an Order Price that is unrealistically large for flower orders e.g. 9 billion (
  9,000,000,000).

## **Appendix: Effort**

Our project aimed to develop a comprehensive solution tailored for florist to manage both client information and order
delivery tracking seamlessly. Unlike AB3. which focuses only on the client entity, our project extended its scope to
include orders, thus introducing complexity in managing bidirectional navigation and ensuring seamless integration
between client and order functionalities.

### Challenges Faced

1. **Bidirectional Navigation** - Implementing bidirectional navigation between orders and clients posed a significant
   challenge. Ensuring that
   modifications to one entity reflected accurately in the other required meticulous attention to detail.
2. **Linking Orders to Clients** - Establishing a robust linkage between orders and clients presented difficulties,
   especially during operations
   like delete or edit. Coordinating changes on both client and order sides to maintain data correctness demanded
   careful
   planning and execution.
3. **Collaborative Development** - Each team member had to work on features and functions independently, necessitating
   close
   collaboration to ensure seamless integration. Communication was important to minimize merging conflicts and ensure
   that
   individual components linked are successfully done.

### Effort Required

The project demanded a considerable effort due to its expanded scope and the complexities associated with managing
multiple entity types. Coordinating development efforts, addressing integration challenges, and ensuring feature
completeness required dedicated time and resources.

### Achievements:

Despite the challenges, we successfully delivered a robust product that allow florists to manage client information
seamlessly while effectively tracking order deliveries.

Key achievements include:

* Implementing bidirectional navigation between client and order entities.
* Establishing robust linkages between orders and clients, ensuring data consistency throughout.
* Facilitating collaborative development and integration efforts to deliver a cohesive solution.
