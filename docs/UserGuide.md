in managing client relationships and orders. Our target audience includes small florist shops, independent floral
designers, and boutique flower businesses.

### 2.2. Assumptions

1. Our application is made with the assumption that users are members of the florist industry and will understand the
   needs as well as the terminology used by florists. They can either be business owners, managers, or employees and
   are looking for a tailored solution to streamline their operations.
2. Users are presumed to have a basic understanding of computer operations and software usage. This can help them to
   navigate easily through the application and follow the instructions to download and use BookKeeper,
   as provided in this guide.

   help users to familiarise themselves with BookKeeper fast, BookKeeper is also entry-level-friendly so that we can
   accommodate users of all levels of technical expertise.

  ignored.<br>

  as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

## 6. Information about how to use the guide

What do the colours mean?

BookKeeper mainly uses four colours: beige, muted green, creamy yellow, and warm brown.

We hoped to achieve a cohesive colour scheme that not only shows visual hierarchy, but provides florists with a sense
of familiarity by choosing colours that are reminiscent of nature. The neutral colour palette caters to a the wide
diversity of florists, be it with respect to age group or gender, while also ensuring that the app remains timeless
and appealing.

This combination of colours not only enhances the aesthetics of BookKeeper, but also promises a user experience that
is consistently positive and engaging.

### 6.3 Planned Features

1. Enhanced Error Messaging
    * Implementing more specific error messages for the "edit" and "editOrder" functions to provide clearer guidance
      to users encountering issues.
2. Enhanced Error Messaging for Wrong Indices with Missing Fields
    * For the `edit` command, if the user fills in 0 fills but an invalid index, the error message is "At least one
      field to edit must be provided."
    * This will be changed to note the invalid index in the future.
3. Extended Tag Length and Error Refinement
    * Increase the maximum length of tags supported within the system, enabling users to provide more descriptive labels
      and organize content effectively.
4. Resolution Support
    * Expand resolution support to include additional screen resolutions such as 1280x720, catering to a broader range
      of devices and user preferences.
5. Allow filtering of orders based on displayed customers.
    * Allow users to filter orders based on the displayed customers, providing a more streamlined and efficient
      experience for users managing multiple clients.
6. Allow adding of multiple users with the same name.
    * Allow users to add multiple clients with the same name, enabling users to manage multiple clients with similar
      names more effectively.
7. Relax constraints on field data types
    * There are constraints on length of values that may prevent overly long fields from being displayed correctly.
        * E.g. do not input a name that is too long, as it may not be displayed correctly.
    * There a constraints on size of values due to the innate storage system. Numbers cannot be too large.
        * E.g. do not input an Order Price that is unrealistically large for flower orders e.g. 9 billion (
          9,000,000,000).

## 7. Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only
   the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the
   application before running the application again.
